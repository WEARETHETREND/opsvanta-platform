# OpsVanta Platform

OpsVanta is a next-generation intelligence platform designed to power real-world operations, human performance, and large-scale decision systems.

Unlike traditional SaaS products, OpsVanta is built as a core intelligence kernel that supports multiple platform layers, including:

- LifeOS — Personal life optimization and financial intelligence
- OpsVanta — Business operations command center
- GrowthOS — Human performance and decision-quality engine
- WorldScore — Societal and systems intelligence mapping

The platform is built around a universal event-driven intelligence architecture:

Event → Signal → Impact → Decision → Action

This structure enables OpsVanta to operate across personal, organizational, and societal domains using a shared intelligence core.

Our mission is to build human-centered intelligence infrastructure that improves clarity, capability, and outcomes across modern life.

This repository documents the public vision and architectural direction of the platform. Core systems are developed privately.
